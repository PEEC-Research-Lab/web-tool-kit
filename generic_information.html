									<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										Welcome to Power Electronics and Energy Control (PEEC) Lab! PEEC is directed by Dr. 
                                        Xiaofan Cui, Assistant Professor of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
                                        Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, and empowered by our students, 
                                        researchers, and all our sponsors.
									</p>
									<h3>What do we do?</h3>
									<p>
										At our lab, we work on the theory and hardware that transform power-electronics-based energy systems, 
                                        from those as small as power conversion circuits to those as large as interconnected microgrids, 
                                        from those as fast as electromagnetic transients to those as slow as electrochemical dynamics. 
                                        Fostered by the high controllability, speed, and power density of power electronics,  
                                        energy systems can be more heterogeneous in form, more agile in actuation, more hierarchical in scale, 
                                        and more distributed in function.
									</p>
									<h3>Our Goal?</h3>
									<p>
										Our ultimate research goal is to bridge the fundamental theory and emerging applications of power-electronics-dominated 
                                        energy systems by innovating control-aware modeling frameworks, provably-correct control policies, 
                                        physics-informed learning schemes, and high-performance hardware validations. 
									</p>
									<h3>Currently, PEEC is focusing on</h3>
                                    <ol>
										<li>High-speed high-frequency power conversion  for information & data systems</li>
										<li>Power management of heterogenous battery energy storage systems</li>
										<li>Nonlinear control and stability of microgrids</li>
										<li>Power-electronics-enabled distributed energy generation and integration</li>
