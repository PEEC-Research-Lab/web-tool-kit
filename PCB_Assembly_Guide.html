									<h2 id="JLCPCB">Ordering a Board from JLCPCB</h2>
									<h3>Step 1: Review JLCPCB Capabilities</h3>
									<p>
										Before placing an order, visit <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-capabilities">JLCPCB’s PCB capabilities page</a>
										to understand their manufacturing specifications. JLCPCB offers two distinct sets of rules: one for standard PCBs and another
										for high-precision PCBs. To optimize costs, it’s advisable to adhere to the standard PCB rules unless your project requires high 
										precision, which should not be required in your early prototype. Give yourself more space: use large-packaged components as 
										much as possible in the prototype phase would make debugging and soldering much easier.
									</p>
									<h3>Step 2: Qualify for Prototype Prices</h3>
									<p>
										JLCPCB offers significantly cheaper prices for PCBs that qualify as prototypes. To meet the prototype criteria 
										(The exact guidelines are subject to change):
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Size: The PCB should not exceed 3900 mil (99 mm) both sides</li>
										<li>Layers: The design should be limited to 2 layers.</li>
										<li>Thickness: The PCB should have a thickness of 1.6 mm.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>
										The default values on their website should be fine, but play with them to see how the price changes. 
										These prototype orders benefit from cost savings because JLCPCB batches multiple small orders together, 
										reducing manufacturing expenses.
									</p>
									<h3>Step 3: Optimize Form Factor for Shipping</h3>
									<p>
										You may not need to do this if your PCB qualifies as a prototype, but your order may contain multiple PCBs. 
										Consider the amount of PCB in one order to reduce shipping costs. Smaller boards that fit within JLCPCB’s 
										smallest packaging options will incur lower shipping fees, further reducing your overall costs 
										(from $12 minimum to $1.5 minimum! But $1.5 would also be the slowest shipping option taking more than one week)
									</p>
									<h3>Step 4: Component Selection for Assembly</h3>
									<p>
										If you opt for JLCPCB’s assembly service, it’s recommended to select components from their 
										<a href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts/basic_parts">basic parts catalog.</a> Prioritize using basic-parts, 
										especially for common components like capacitors and resistors, to minimize costs and reduce lead times.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Avoid Uncommon Values</b> Using rare or uncommon component values can increase both cost and procurement time. 
											Instead, consider using standard values and, if necessary, apply series-parallel techniques to achieve the desired 
											specifications during the prototype phase.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your PCB manufacturing and assembly costs while ensuring 
										that your design meets the necessary requirements.
